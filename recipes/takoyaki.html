    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Takoyaki are a Japanese street snack that originated in the city of Osaka. 
        They are little round balls of batter that are slightly crispy on the outside and a bit soft
         and gooey on the inside, stuffed with a little nugget of octopus, 
         tempura bits, and green onions. Typically they serve them up in little
          wooden boats, brushed with takoyaki sauce, drizzled with Japanese kewpie mayo,
           and topped with bonito flakes and seaweed. They come with skewers or chopsticks 
           to pick them up. They’re super popular and probably one of the most well known 
           Japanese foods out there.
         Charmingly, you can almost always see people standing around the stands 
         fanning their mouths because the takoyaki is too hot. Takoyaki is pure comfort food.

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the batter up with a whisk making sure there are no floury bits.</li>
        <li>Prep all of the fillings. Cut up the octopus, slice the green onions and make 
            sure you have everything at the ready: a little dish of oil, 
            all your ingredients, some skewers to flip the balls, and a plate to serve on. 
            Heat up the pan.</li>
        <li> Generously oil the pan with a brush or a paper towel dipped in oil. 
            Give the batter a whisk then pour into the individual compartments all the way up to the top. 
            It’s okay if they overflow a bit.
            Add in the fillings and let cook until the edges start to look more solid and opaque.</li>
        <li>Use your skewers to turn the takoyaki 90 degrees. 
            If they don’t easily move, they need more time to crisp up. Once they’re at a 90° angle, 
            pour in a bit more batter to ensure a super round ball. 
            Let cook, stuffing in any excess batter that’s outside the ball, then turn again. 
            You should have a round ball. Cook until the balls are crispy and brown, 
            moving the balls around from mold to mold to evenly cook 
            (this is because most pans will have uneven heating). 
            As the balls crisp up, it will be easier to flip them.</li>
        <li> When the balls are golden and crisp, 
            pop them on a plate and brush with takoyaki sauce and squeeze on some mayo.</li>
    </ol>
